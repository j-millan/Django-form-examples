### Django form examples

 Some form cases I created using django 2.2 and bootstrap 4.

 They're all functional (though the login form still has some validation problems), but i aim mainly for the styles.

 Other django apps it needs to work: [django-widget-tweaks](https://github.com/jazzband/django-widget-tweaks), [django-countries](https://github.com/SmileyChris/django-countries), [django-phone-number-field](https://github.com/stefanfoulis/django-phonenumber-field).
